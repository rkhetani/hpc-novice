1.  Introduction to HPC and accessing the cluster (30-45 min)

    a.  Discussion of computer components (CPU, storage, memory)

    b.  Explanation of terminology (nodes, cores, threads, cluster,
        serial/parallel processes)

    c.  Structure of the cluster (login nodes, job scheduler, etc.)

    d.  Accessing the cluster with ssh and discussion of cluster
        filesystem set-up

    e.  **Activity:** practice navigating the filesystem using Unix
        commands â€“ navigate between /home and /groups

2.  Transferring files to/from the cluster (20-30 min)

    a.  Filezilla and scp (macs only)

    b.  **Activity:** transferring files to/from cluster

3.  Accessing tools in the cluster by exporting PATH and using modules
    (30-45 min)

    a.  Explain the PATH variable (15-20 min)

    b.  Explain modules, discuss module commands (15-20 min)

    c.  **Activity:** perform blastn or other exercise by exporting to
        the PATH variable

    d.  **Activity:** perform blastn (or other exercise) by loading the
        blastn module (or other tool)

    e.  **Activity:** place the blastn module load command in .bashrc 
	or .bash_profile, so blastn is always available in the path

4.  Queues and partitions/allocations (30 min)

    a.  Discussion of batch job scheduler, queuing and scheduling

    b.  Queue structure and priority

    c.  Job scheduler commands

    d.  **Activity:** start an interactive session, specifying specific
        options (number of cores, notification when job finishes,
        sending output to file, runlimit, etc.)

    e.  **Activity:** write a simple shell script and convert it into a 
	job submission script (with the same directives as the interactive session),
	followed by running it as a background job 
	(*Note: this question leads into the next session.*)

5.  Submission scripts and batch job submission (30 min)

    a.  Explain more in-depth the required components of a submission script

    b.  Display how to write a submission script for the blastn exercise
        previously performed

    c.  Discuss batch job submission

    d.  **Activity:** Change the submission script to perform batch
        submission of blastn on multiple files and monitor progress of
        job in queue.
        
    e.  **Activity:** Change the submission script to perform batch
        submission of blastn on multiple files using multiple cores this time
        and note the difference in speed.
        (*NOTE: this question leads into the next session.*)

    f.  **Activity:** Submit the same job to a different queue and see
        differences in time to job completion

6.  MPI and multithreading (30 min)

    a.  Types of parallelism and MPI concepts

    c. **Activity:** Submit a script that depends on MPI
